In November 2019 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49891159) one in two people who appealed in court against a decision to deny them disability benefits was successful.

In total, more than 550,000 people won an appeal over their benefits at tribunal between 2013 and 2018.

The success rates showed benefits assessments were beset by "poor decision-making" and "obvious inaccuracies", charities said.

The government said only around 5% of disability decisions were overturned.

Benefits assessments are carried out on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) by the private contractors Capita, the Independent Assessment Services (formerly called Atos) and Maximus.

Capita and Maximus, two of the private companies who carry out assessments, said the majority of people were satisfied with the process and they worked with charities and disabled people's organisations to improve their services further."

The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed figures from Freedom of Information responses from HM Courts and Tribunals Service and Northern Ireland's Department for Communities (DfC).

Most of the appeals concerned Employment Support Allowance (ESA), which is paid to people unable to work because of illness or disability; the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which is paid to people with extra care or mobility needs; and Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which was introduced to replace DLA

The analysis found:

- About 553,000 successful appeals were heard at tribunal about disability, sickness and incapacity benefits out of 981,000 from 2013 to 2018
- Last year, around two thirds of cases heard in Great Britain found in favour of the claimant. In Northern Ireland, the figure was around 54% in 2018-19
